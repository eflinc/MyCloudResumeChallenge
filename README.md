ðŸš€ AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

I managed to complete my Cloud Resume Challenge several weeks ago and learned so much along the way. There were times where I could not get it to work, or my formatting was a tad bad, but overcame all the challenges I faced. What I am left with is an online resume, that I am already modifying as this will serve as my static AWS website. I hope to enhance the HTML behind it and add couple of tabs so one can serve as a landing page, while the next tab can contain my resume.

ðŸ”§ The Project
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on, real-world project designed to help aspiring cloud professionals build and showcase their skills by creating a cloud-hosted resume site. Itâ€™s especially popular among those preparing for cloud roles like DevOps Engineer, Cloud Architect, or IT Infrastructure Engineer 

 ðŸ”§ Tools Used
 Â· An AWS Subscription
Â·  A GitHub Subscription for version control
Â·  Frontend Hosting (S3 + CloudFront)
Â·  DynamoDB
Â·  CI/CD
Â·  CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
 
 ðŸ§± What It Involves
The original challenge consists of 16 steps that guide you through building and deploying a resume site using cloud technologies. Here's a breakdown:
â€¢	Create a resume in HTML/CSS
â€¢	Host it on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS S3 with CloudFront or Azure Blob Storage)
â€¢	Enable HTTPS
â€¢	Add a visitor counter using a cloud database (e.g., DynamoDB or Cosmos DB)
â€¢	Use a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda or Azure Functions) to update the counter
â€¢	Write infrastructure as code using tools like Terraform or ARM templates
â€¢	Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment from GitHub
â€¢	Use version control and GitHub Actions
â€¢	Write tests for your code
â€¢	Document everything in a README

 ðŸŒŒ Why Itâ€™s Valuable
â€¢	Demonstrates practical cloud skills
â€¢	Builds a portfolio project you can show to employers
â€¢	Covers key areas like serverless, CI/CD, IaC, and security
â€¢	Helps bridge the gap between certification and real-world experience
